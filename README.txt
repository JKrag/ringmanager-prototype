This is a prototype I built in 2012 during a number of assignments in the Coursera/Stanford course: Human-Computer Interaction

The main purpose of the prototype was to go through the full practise of identifying user needs, describing a possible computer system to help, creating mockups, and finaly doing some level of implementation, in order to perform different levels Heuristic evaluation and user testing with real users.

The mock-ups were created in balsamiq, but are not currently part of this repo. I might add them later when I get back to my old laptop.

The design I envisioned was "intended" for use on a tablet, and the idea was that it should heavily based on drag-drop interactions, so in order to have some sort of realistic user-testing, I decided to try my luck with my first ever jQuery based UI.

The first tested version, where the central page was still a mockup, is online on: http://xpresso.dk/hciproject/
The "final" prototype, with the finished interactive page, is available on: http://xpresso.dk/hciproject2/

The page with most of the actual fun stuff (the jQuery stuff) is http://xpresso.dk/hciproject2/judging.html

There is no back-end at all. These are all static html-pages with hard-coded dummy data, as the only purpose was to learn to test, evaluate and improve the user experience.

This is the only one of my Coursera courses where I have chosen to make the code available on Github (the rest are in private repo's on Bitbucket), and I have only done so because this is a very personal assignment, and the whole background for this specific app will not even make sense to many people, so I don't think it will be of any use to other future students of this course. (there are far better examples and tutorials on jQuery available online anyway).

If anyone still considers this a problem, please let me know.
